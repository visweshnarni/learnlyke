To implement Stripe Checkout for an application fee, I would first create a payment_requests row when the user initiates payment, storing the application ID, amount, and status pending. Next, I would call stripe.checkout.sessions.create() and pass the amount, currency, customer email, and a success/cancel URL. I would store the returned session_id and payment_intent in payment_requests so I can reconcile later. Stripe webhooks (e.g., checkout.session.completed) handle the final state: I verify the webhook signature, find the matching payment_requests row using the session ID, and update its status to paid. After payment succeeds, I mark the related application as fee_paid = true or advance its stage. This ensures the app remains the source of truth and Stripe remains the processor.
